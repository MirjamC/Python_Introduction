    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python was developed in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. The purpose of Python was to create a programming language that is both simple to understand and readable. Python works on different platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux, etc. It is a very popular programming language in data analysis and data science because of its versatality. Python is open source, and can therefore be used for free."
